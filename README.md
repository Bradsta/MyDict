# MyDict
MyDict is the re-branding of the first Android application I ever created originally called Encyclo-Dictionary. It is a utility application that can define multiple people, terms, places, and events simlutaneously. It was very useful for my highschool history class assignments where I was to define a list of terms (this was actually the reason I created the app in the first place!)

The original release of Encyclo-Dictionary was in May 2012.
