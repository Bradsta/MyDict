# MyDict
MyDict is the re-branding of the first Android application I ever created originally called Encyclo-Dictionary.

I created Encyclo-Dictionary when I was in highschool and the original release of the app was in May 2012.

I am unaware whether or not MyDict still works today, however the store listing on Google Play can be found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamicarts.mydict&hl=en
